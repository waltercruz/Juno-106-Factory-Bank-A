Juno-106 Factory Bank A emulated for TAL U-No-LX
Author: Binary Oblivion (Jonathan Nicol)

Based in part on user-created Juno-106 presets found at http://www.jarvik7.net/juno-106/ and user-created JU-06 presets found at https://data.dynareg.se/breadandbutter/JU06.html. Many thanks to the authors of those soundsets.

The presets have been further fine tuned by ear using the SynthMania Juno-106 demonstration (http://www.synthmania.com/juno-106.htm) as a reference. The audio demos included with this soundset emulate the SynthMania demos. Many thanks to Paolo Di Nicolantonio for creating such a wonderful resource.
